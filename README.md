# code
yeah I'm remaking this with a better understanding of OOP, making high class functions and separating the goddamn files into individual ones because grade 10 me doesn't know how to make into different files despite my understanding of python barely increasing

anyways main.py has the brains
src/crawler.py will contain all the code for parsing anchor tags and making webcrawlers, probably gonna add some interfaces, maybe some builders if I really need to because this is python the fuck is OOP

src/consts.py has various programming constants like verbose, quiet and more in the future

src/logger.py is gonna have all of the verbose logging into text files

src/db.py will contain all of the SQLite3 database interaction code e.g. insert queries, creating tables, etc.
